# Data with Notebooks

An application used for displaying notebooks and their associated datasets. Users will be able to access the read-only version of the notebook, download the datasets, and eventually open the notebook in the I-GUIDE Platform JupyterHub environment to run the notebook.

## Project Status
This project is under development currently. We are working on our first milestone: building the application prototype.

## Installation
### Clone the repo from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-with-notebooks.git
```

### Run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.


### Run the production server:
```bash
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
